# Gender detection using deep learning with keras.
The keras model is created by training  on 1300 face images (~6500 for each class). Face region is cropped by applying `face detection` using `Opencv` on the images gathered from Google Images.Used 6 gender(male,female) after generated with ImageDataGenerator.

**Note: Python 2.x is not supported**

## Python packages
* numpy
* tensorflow_gpu
* OpenCv
* PyQt5
* Matplotlib


Install the required packages by executing the following command.

`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`

 





## Usage

### If you want before training model!
`$ python train.py`

### Real-time gender detection(webcam)

`$ python deep.py`


- If you have an Nvidia GPU, then you can install `tensorflow-gpu` package. It will make things run a lot faster.
Depending on the hardware configuration of your system, the execution time will vary. On CPU, training will be slow. Please use onlu tensorflow_gpu  GPU .


- Minimal:
- 8gb RAM
- Core i5
- Nvidia
